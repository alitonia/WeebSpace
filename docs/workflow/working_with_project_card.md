# Quick guide to Cards

### When you are bored

* Goto to __Project/Core Gameplay__.
* Pick a card in __To do__.
* Go to that issue, say something like _"I'm on it"_, assign yourself to that issue.
* Move that card from __To do__ to __In progress__.
* Work on it.


### When you are bored with coding

* Pick a card in review.
* Goto that issue and review. No coding involved.
* Comment to show your approval/disapproval. Your opinion has direct effect on the development of this project.


### When you want to administrate

* Move __Cards__ at _Add new Card_ to __To do__, or __Backlog__.
* Move __Cards__ in review with enough approvals (maybe >3?) to __Review approved__.


### When you want to be creative

* Open new issues for features/ideas that you have. Try to be __realistic__ with this.
* Update docs on feature/proposal/direction you want to make.


### When you want to make an important decision

* Decision such as __rebase__, __delete branch__, __release__, __fundamental changes to game logic/implementation__
 should be:
    * discussed by opening a new issue
    * tag all current active developers in for opinion. 
    * an approval rate of 4/5 might indicate this change may go through, but it is largely based on the context.
    * In any case, try to be __humble__, __polite__, and __professional__ towards your develop-mates.


### When you want to contribute but is not yet a contributor

* Open a new issue, state what and how you want it. We will get back to you as soon as possible.

* If you just want to make a onetime contribution without joining, just go with it. We appreciate all helps.
